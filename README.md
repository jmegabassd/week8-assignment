> Adding the delete function went very smoothly, also added a page to add posts easier than just putting them directly into Supabase, in reality I wouldn't use this on the live site, I would have this maybe as a admin page. I managed to make it so I could just copy the entire YouTube url and the function replaces the URL with just the video id, I found this in one of the links below and used a website to translate php to javascript.

## What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

## What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

> I managed to mess up my local file saves, then got in a muddle with Git, was silly enough to not use branching, I fixed the issue in the end by deleting my local files and doing a git clone, I lost a couple of housr of work.
