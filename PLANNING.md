## Plan your database schema

- Tools: drawsql

- Questions: how many tables do I need? What is the relationship between the tables?

## Set up your database tables using your schema

- Purpose: to create our tables and seed dummy data.

## Set up your project

## Upload the project to GitHub

## Deploy your project in Vercel

## (optional, but highly recommended) Organise your tasks in Trello.

## Version control: use each assignment as an opportunity to get better at branches, and pushing code to GitHub.

## Environments: set up .env files to store environment variables and API urls
